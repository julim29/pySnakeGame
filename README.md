# pySnakeGame
This is the old snake game implemented in python using the well-known library pygame. There are still a lot of features that are yet to be developed, but at this state, this game can be played.<br>
In the future I'm planning to make an online two-player version of this game in python.<br>
To run it, simply clone this git, and run the main.py file.
